# Getting Started

## Task
Basketball Scoreboard App
This is the Basketball Scoreboard App project that is part of the [Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path](scrimba.com)
- Build it from "scratch"
- Follow the design [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/nUZJZMdrxo7oxf52iOHqCV/Basketball-Scoreboard--Copy-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=RsdCMIFCaSUJ2ISY-0)
- Make all six buttons work

## Stretch Goals

- Add a "New Game" button (sets both scores to 0 for a new game)
- Highlight the leader
- Add a few more counters (e.g. period, fouls, timer)
- Change the design - perhaps change the counter to a different type of sport, then change the buttons to work with that scoring.
